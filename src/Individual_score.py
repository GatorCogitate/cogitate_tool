This module's purpose is to calculate the individual scoring of software.
developers in a Github repository. It will calculate a developer's score

# For 3/3/2020:
# TODO Fake data - start with dictionary - Madelyn *
# TODO function for commit score - Teona *
# TODO function for added lines score - Teona *
# TODO function for deleted lines - Wonjoon *
# TODO lines modified score - Madelyn *
# TODO lines per commit score - Wonjoon *
# TODO amount of files modified overall score - Madelyn *
# TODO file for printing the individual score - Teona *
# TODO average of all scores - Everyone, once other features are finished

# Possible other features or scoring metrics:
# TODO amount of files per commit score
# TODO talk about using PyGithub to retrieve issue data
# TODO amount of comments in lines of code score - research tools for parsing
# TODO date distribution score
# TODO average overall score and individual score to produce new individual score
# TODO give notification of duplicate username if there is one, or the possibility
# TODO User inputs the weight for each category for finding total individual score

# Helpful reminders:
# Use pipeline programming style
# Implement test cases as functions are written in the test_individual_scoring.py file
# Scoring will be done first as percentages ((individual contribution/total branch)*100)

# Add fake data that corresponds to overall-eval-analyzing-metrics branch
# github_data uses the pattern ["username", commit_total, lines_added,
# lines_deleted, total_lines, modified_lines, lines_per_commit, files_changed]
